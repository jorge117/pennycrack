The penitentia code was devised as a challenge by a lecturer at Keele University. It is unknown if this is a code obfuscating intelligible language or gibberish, and incredibly limited information can be found to confirm/deny most hypotheses or notions.

"Gordon created this manuscript for two reasons.

One was curiosity. Most modern codes are based on a shared set of underlying assumptions. He wondered what would happen if you deliberately ignored those assumptions. What sorts of code might that produce?

The second was to demonstrate a point. It was widely argued in the Voynich research community that Edward Kelley couldn’t have created both Enochian and Voynichese because those were too different from each other to be the work of one person. The Penitentia Manuscript is very different from Gordon’s Ricardus Manuscript, but they were both produced by the same person.

Both the Penitentia Manuscript and the Ricardus Manuscript have been freely available on the Web since 2005. As far as we know, neither has ever been cracked." - http://hydeandrugg.com/pages/codes/penitentia

"Why?
My work on expert reasoning and on the Voynich manuscript brought home to me how modern cryptography tends to work from a set of technologically convenient starting points, such as alphanumeric symbols. I wondered what would happen if you worked from a different starting point. The Penitentia manuscript is an example of this. It also follows up another couple of points raised by Voynichese script: how minimalist can a script be, and does minimalism bring any aesthetic consequences? The Penitentia manuscript contains reversibly coded material, but I'm mainly interested in it as an exercise in calligraphy.

Answers to likely FAQs
Yes, the thumbnails are all oriented in the same direction as each other - I haven't scrambled them. Yes, there's a sequence in the ordering of the thumbnails. No, there aren't any hints about which way up the images go, or which direction the script is read in (except that it's consistent across each file). No, this doesn't contain a super-code - I expect professional cryptographers could work out what the coding system is pretty swiftly if they felt so inclined. No, it doesn't contain the location of buried treasure. No, I don't plan to get into correspondence about this, give any hints, or discuss proposed solutions - I already get large quantities of email about my other work. If you want to discuss this with other like-minded souls, I'd suggest getting in touch with them via a posting on an appropriate Usenet group, and then setting up a mailing list or Usenet group. This is intended to be a source of harmless fun, not a serious challenge." - http://www.scm.keele.ac.uk/research/knowledge_modelling/km/people/gordon_rugg/cryptography/penitentia/

To date (Aug 2016), attempts at 'cracking' the penitentia manuscript have been sporadic and unfruitful. There have been a number of assumptions and observations made detailed in another text file within this folder. Limited analysis had been performed either manually or by using Weka 3, extracting forms of data from the original files. All source code and results can be found within this git.
